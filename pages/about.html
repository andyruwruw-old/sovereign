<h1>SOVEREIGN</h1>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Sovereign starts you off as a single house land owner, and allows you to slowely build your empire until you have covered all of the land.</p>
<p>The game might be available but won't be quite finished until this April. The plan is to have a grid of land chunks, to which you can</p>
<p>invade and spread.</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>I'm working on Sovereign for a class project in my Web Programming course.</p>
<p>The project was meant to span over the course of the whole semester so I picked something I thought would be challenging.</p>
<p>I love the game "A Dark Room" by Doublespeak Games. It's the only text based game I've ever had the patience to play through multiple times.</p>
<p>With very little programing skills, I thought it would be fun to make my own spin off of the game, with influences from my younger</p>
<p>Years spent playing real time strategy games such as Age of Mythology or StarCraft. The game requires you to manage resources effectively</p>
<p>to grow and avoid invasion. For fun I plan on adding settings so you can change up your game play.</p>
